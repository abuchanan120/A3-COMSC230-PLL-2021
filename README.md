I changed the base COMSC230 Web Design page into a custom website for the 2021 Season of the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL). The main index page gives info about the PLL, with the teams page showing relevant team data for the season, and the champs page showing the 2021 Playoffs Champions with some info about their team.
